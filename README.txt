TicTacToe version 1.1

This is a responsive designed, unbeatable TicTacToe game.
In this version I decided to rewrite most of the AI logic since version 1.0 was poorly written. 
It features 3 difficulty levels and it gives the player the option to choose his mark.
In the game 'X' plays first every time.

The AI on unbeatable level will randomly pick one of the most optimal moves in order to
ensure that every game feels at least somewhat different while still being unbeatable.
